  <h1>Scary Cinema</h1>
  <p>
    So I grew up in a crazy cult and was never allowed to watch horror or any
    kind of scary movies; hence my quest for the best scary movies.
    It can't just be any kind of scary - I don't like slasher films and I don't
    scare easily. I prefer more "cerebral" scary movies to "jump scare" scary
    movies. Yes, I've seen all the "classics" and to date, am unimpressed.
    Below is a brief list and description of some of my favorite scary films
    I've found so far! *All descriptions from imdb.com*

  <h3>Hereditary 2018</h3>
    <p>
      After the family matriarch passes away, a grieving family is haunted
      by tragic and disturbing occurrences, and begin to unravel dark secrets.
    </p>
    <h3>Haunting in Connecticut 2009</h3>
      <p>
        After a family is forced to relocate for their son' health, they begin
        experiencing supernatural behavior in their new home, and uncover a
        sinister history.
      </p>
      <h3>The Ring 2002</h3>
        <p>
          A journalist must investigate a mysterious videotape which seems to
          cause the death of anyone in a week of viewing it.
