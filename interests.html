    Chicago's Derby Little Secret
    The Chicago Outfit was founded in the fall of 2007. We are a democratic
    roller derby league run by the skaters, for the skaters. We are an all-female
    flat track roller derby league based in the city of Chicago.
    Our goal is to create a positive female community dedicated to contributing
    charitably to other non-profit organizations. We, as skaters, strive to
    develop the skills necessary to compete within the Women's Flat Track Derby
    Association (WFTDA).
    As of June 2017, 2010, we are proud members of WFTDA. The Chicago Outfit
    represents roller derby internationally with class, sass, and dignity.
